# DisasterSurvival

Disaster Survival is a Spigot plugin played in a 50x50 arena that is reset after every few natural disasters.

Players must try to survive a random natural disaster for 60 seconds while trying to get other players killed. Players can use sticks with extra knockback, snowballs, and other tools to mess with other players.

Disaster Survival is currently a work-in-progress.

## Currently Implemented Disasters
- Flash Flood - Rapidly rising water that damages any players inside it.
- Flash Fire - Multiple small fires start and rapidly spread all over the arena.
- Earthquake - Blocks collapse randomly if not supported, and random chunks of the arena are flung into the air as falling block entities.
